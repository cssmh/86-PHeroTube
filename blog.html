    <h1>Scope of <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>const</code></h1>

    <p>
      In JavaScript, the scope of variables is an important concept. The
      keywords <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>const</code> are
      used for variable declaration, and they differ in terms of scope,
      hoisting, and reassignment.
    </p>

    <h2><code>var</code></h2>
    <p>
      <code>var</code> is function-scoped. It is hoisted to the top of its
      function and can be redeclared and reassigned.
    </p>

    <pre>
    <code>
function example() {
  var x = 1;
  if (true) {
    var x = 2; // Same variable as above
    console.log(x); // Outputs 2
  }
  console.log(x); // Outputs 2
}
    </code>
  </pre>

    <h2><code>let</code></h2>
    <p>
      <code>let</code> is block-scoped. It is hoisted to the top of its block
      and can be reassigned but not redeclared in the same scope.
    </p>

    <pre>
    <code>
function example() {
  let y = 1;
  if (true) {
    let y = 2; // Different variable than 
    the one outside the block
    console.log(y); // Outputs 2
  }
  console.log(y); // Outputs 1
}
    </code>
  </pre>

    <h2><code>const</code></h2>
    <p>
      <code>const</code> is also block-scoped. It cannot be redeclared or
      reassigned, but for objects and arrays, their properties or elements can
      be modified.
    </p>

    <pre>
    <code>
function example() {
  const z = 1;
  if (true) {
    const z = 2; // Different variable than 
    the one outside the block
    console.log(z); // Outputs 2
  }
  console.log(z); // Outputs 1
}
    </code>
  </pre>

      <h1>Use Cases of <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code></h1>

      <h2><code>null</code></h2>
      <p>
        The value <code>null</code> represents the intentional absence of any
        object value or the absence of a value itself. It is often used in the
        following scenarios:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Explicitly Indicating Absence:</strong> You can assign
          <code>null</code> to a variable or property to explicitly indicate
          that it has no value or is intentionally empty.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Resetting Values:</strong> It can be used to reset or clear
          the value of a variable or object property.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>As a Placeholder:</strong> Sometimes <code>null</code> is used
          as a placeholder when a value is expected but not yet available or
          applicable.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2><code>undefined</code></h2>
      <p>
        The value <code>undefined</code> represents the uninitialized state of a
        variable or the absence of a value in a property. It is commonly
        encountered in the following situations:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Uninitialized Variables:</strong> Variables that are declared
          but not assigned a value are by default set to <code>undefined</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Function Parameters:</strong> If a function is called with
          fewer arguments than declared parameters, the missing parameters will
          have a value of <code>undefined</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Object Properties:</strong> If you access an object property
          that does not exist, the result is <code>undefined</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Example:</p>

      <pre>
    <code>
// Using null
let user = null; // Explicitly indicating absence

// Using undefined
let age; // Uninitialized variable, set to 
undefined function example(parameter) {
  console.log(parameter); // If no argument 
  is passed, parameter will be undefined }
example();
    </code>

      <h1>What is REST API?</h1>

      <p>
        REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for
        designing networked applications. REST API, or RESTful API, is a set of
        rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services
        following the principles of REST.
      </p>

      <p>In a REST API:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Resources:</strong> Data or services are represented as
          resources, identified by URLs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>HTTP Methods:</strong> Operations on resources are performed
          using standard HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stateless:</strong> Each request from a client contains all
          the information needed to understand and process the request. The
          server does not store the client's state between requests.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Representation:</strong> Resources can have multiple
          representations, such as JSON or XML, and clients can request the
          representation they prefer.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Here is a simple example of a REST API endpoint:</p>

      <pre>
    <code>
GET /api/users
    </code>
  </pre>

      <p>
        This endpoint might retrieve a list of users as a response. REST APIs
        are commonly used in web development to enable communication between
        different systems and to create scalable and maintainable applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, REST API provides a standardized way for systems to communicate
        over the web, allowing for interoperability between different
        applications and services.
